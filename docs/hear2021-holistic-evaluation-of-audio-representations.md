abstract: >
  Humans can infer a wide range of properties from a perceived sound, such as information about the source (e.g. what
  generated the sound? where is it coming from?), the information the sound conveys (this is a word that means X, this is
  a musical note in scale Y), and how it compares to other sounds (these two sounds come/don't come from the same source
  and are/aren't identical). Can any one learned representation do the same?
  <br><br>
  The aim of this competition is to develop a general-purpose audio representation that provides a meaningful basis for
  learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios. We challenge participants with the following questions: Is it
  possible to develop a single representation that models all psychoacoustic phenomena? What approach best generalizes to
  a wide range of downstream audio tasks without fine-tuning? What audio representation allows researchers to formulate
  and solve novel and societally-valuable problems in simple, repeatable ways?
  <br><br>
  We will evaluate audio representations using a benchmark suite across a variety of domains, including speech,
  environmental sound, medical audio, and music. In the spirit of shared exchange, all participants must submit an audio
  embedding model, following a common API, that is general-purpose, open-source, and freely available to use.
