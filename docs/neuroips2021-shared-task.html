title: NeuroIPS 2021 Shared Task: General Purpose Off-The-Shelf Audio Representations for Classification, Tagging, and Distance Tasks

abstract: Current audio representations are typically not evaluated on a broad-range of audio problems. Evaluation is usually ad-hoc. Thus, it is difficult to know which audio representation is suitable for a novel audio learning task. We propose a competition: Participants must submit an off-the-shelf audio representation model that is general-purpose, open-source, and freely available to use. All submissions must follow a common API. Evaluation will comprise a suite of a) existing popular audio benchmarks; b) societally important but less well-known benchmarks; and c) new benchmarks. Benchmarks span multiple audio domains: speech, environmental sound, clinical audio, and music, with tasks that involve short and long time spans. Evaluation will be on classification, tagging, and distance tasks, and code for the benchmark suite will be shared as an easy-to-use package for future work. The impact on the broader ML community of this proposed competition is several-fold: a) having a nuanced understanding of which audio models work in which settings, and what their particular weaknesses are; b) instilling better insight into under-represented audio tasks that benefit humanity, such as low-resource speech, environmental safety, clinical speech, and ethnomusicology; c) encouraging general-purpose easy-to-use freely-available audio representations to be released by participants that follow a common API; and d) broadening evaluation criteria by compiling and standardizing a broad-scale multi-domain benchmark suite.
