## Plenary Session
We will be sharing the results of the HEAR 2021 evaluation live at NeurIPS 2021
on December 7th from 19:05-19:25 GMT during the 
[Competition Track Day 1 Session](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=21954).

The Zoom link for the plenary and breakout sessions will be available to all
registered NeurIPS attendees.

## Breakout Session
Directly after the plenary session we will be hosting a breakout Zoom call
to give some of our top participants an opportunity to present their work. 
Invited speakers have been asked to prepare a 5-minute lightning talk. Following
the lightning talks we will have an open question and discussion period.

The breakout session will start at 19:25 GMT and last for approximately one hour.
