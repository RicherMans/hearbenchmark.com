  We believe that machine learning for audio should connect all subcommunities of audio ML researchers (speech,
  music, environmental sounds, etc.). Moreover, we encourage cross-polination of audio ML research with adjacent fields,
  such as vision, deep learning, traditional DSP, NLP, and beyond. We specifically encourage benchmarking on audio ML
  tasks that have high societal impact, in addition to our broader mission of promoting cross-domain evaluation and
  knowledge sharing.
