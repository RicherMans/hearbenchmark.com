title: Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations
banner: true
---

What audio embedding approach generalizes best to a wide range of downstream tasks 
across a variety of everyday domains without fine-tuning? 

The aim of the HEAR benchmark is to develop a general-purpose audio representation 
that provides a strong basis for learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios. HEAR evaluates audio representations using a benchmark suite across a variety of 
domains, including speech, environmental sound, and music.

HEAR consists of:
* A benchmark of nineteen diverse tasks. These tasks encompass multiple audio domains: 
  speech, environmental sound, and music, with tasks that involve short and long time spans;
* Open-source evaluation code. Evaluation consists of classification tasks, both 
  multiclass and multilabel, requiring either prediction over the entire audio 
  scene (clip), or temporal-based onset detection of sound event;
* An API for developing HEAR-compatible models, making it easy for researchers to
  develop new models and perform evaluation using HEAR evaluation code;
* A leaderboard to keep track of performance on the HEAR benchmark.

The HEAR benchmark was launched as a NeurIPS competition in 2021. 
Please see our upcoming [journal article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03022), 
to appear in the PMLR issue on NeurIPS 2021 Competitions, for more information on HEAR.
