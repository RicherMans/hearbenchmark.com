abstract: >
  What audio embedding approach generalizes best to a wide range
  of downstream tasks across a variety of everyday domains without
  fine-tuning? The aim of the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS challenge is to
  develop a general-purpose audio representation that provides a
  strong basis for learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios.
  HEAR 2021 evaluates audio representations using a benchmark suite
  across a variety of domains, including speech, environmental
  sound, and music. In the spirit of shared exchange, each participant
  submitted an audio embedding model following a <a
  href="hear2021-rules.html">common API</a> that is general-purpose,
  open-source, and freely available to use.
  Twenty-nine models by thirteen external teams were evaluated on
  nineteen diverse downstream tasks derived from sixteen datasets.
  Open <a href="https://github.com/neuralaudio/hear-eval-kit/">evaluation
  code</a>, <a
  href="https://github.com/neuralaudio/hear2021-submitted-models/">submitted
  models</a> and <a href="hear2021-datasets.html">datasets</a> are
  key contributions, enabling comprehensive and reproducible
  evaluation, as well as previously impossible longitudinal studies.
  It still remains an open question whether one single general-purpose
  audio representation can perform as holistically as the human
  ear.
