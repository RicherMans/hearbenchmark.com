    classification problem. The goal of this task is to classify
    instrumental sounds from the
    <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth">NSynth
    Dataset</a> into one of 88 pitches. Results for this task are measured
    by pitch accuracy as well as chroma accuracy. The chroma accuracy metric
    only considers the pitch class and disregards octave errors.'
