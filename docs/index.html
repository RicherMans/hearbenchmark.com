creator: Authors
date: 2021
abstract: We believe that machine learning for audio should connect all subcommunitites of audio ML researchers (speech, music, environmental sounds, etc.). Moreover, we encourage cross-polination of audio ML research with that of adjacent fields, such as vision, traditional DSP, deep learning, NLP, and beyond.
