title: Neural Audio AI
creator: Authors
date: 2021
abstract: We believe that machine learning for audio should connect all subcommunities of audio ML researchers (speech, music, environmental sounds, etc.). Moreover, we encourage cross-polination of audio ML research with adjacent fields, such as vision, deep learning, traditional DSP, NLP, and beyond. We specifically encourage benchmarking on audio ML tasks that have high societal impact, in addition to our broader mission of promoting cross-domain evaluation and knowledge sharing.
