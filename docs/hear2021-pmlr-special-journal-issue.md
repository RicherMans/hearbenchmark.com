## Summary


PMLR will publish a HEAR special issue. Everyone is encouraged to
submit, including submissions that were not part of the NeurIPS
2021 challenge.

The submission deadline is February 28th, 2022. Please [email
us](mailto:deep at neuralaudio dot ai) if you need an extension.
There is no page limit.

Besides evaluating on the HEAR 2021 [tasks](hear2021-datasets) using
[heareval](https://github.com/neuralaudio/hear-eval-kit/), we
encourage submissions to do broader experimental work. For example:

* experiment with larger hyperparameter grids and more grid points
* ablation studies
* measure model variance under different weight initializations
* augment the training data

If you make any interesting progress on evaluation methodology, we
encourage you to [submit a
PR](https://github.com/neuralaudio/hear-eval-kit/pulls) so that
other submitters can benefit from your contributions.
